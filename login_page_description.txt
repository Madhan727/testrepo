4. If both match, login is successful.
5. If not, an error message is shown.

5. ADVANTAGES
- Easy to understand
- Beginner friendly
- No external libraries required
- Works with only Python

6. LIMITATIONS

- Password is visible while typing
- Not secure for real applications

7. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Hide password input
